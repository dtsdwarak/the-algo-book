#The super-awesome Algorithms Book


Ha ha. The title does sound a little funny! Learning algorithms is no easy task and being good at it takes time and effort. 

This is my attempt at simplifying this task. I am no Cormen or Karumanchi or even that random StackExchange guy who'd help us for that matter. Trust me, at the time of this writing, I am as good as a guy who just got oomphed up for a simple "hello world" output. And that is exactly why I want you to come along as I travel through all the seven seas and kingdoms in discovering where I belong. I hope I'll continue to tread this path towards becoming the master Shifu and I guess this journey shall be enjoyable to you as well, should you join me!  

Well, not quite the preface any algorithms book would have. Nevertheless, works!

Let the journey begin.
